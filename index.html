<h1> My name is Jeremy </h1>
<p> I am a web development and UX design student. This is my first year at Wake Tech. In my free time I like working on cars and playing video games.
    I am not the greatest at html coding, however, I have picked it up pretty quick since this is not my first class having to use it.
    I wanted to learn how to code because i feel like it would be a good skill to know and it will never be a dying field. </p>
